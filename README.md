# Expense & Budget Tracker

## Project Overview

A university individual assignment for managing personal income, expenses, and monthly budgets. Development is split into exactly eight parts. This checkout implements **Part 1: Project Foundation** only.

## Features

Implemented: responsive starting screen, React Router navigation, live API health check with loading/error/retry states, Express API, and MongoDB connection configuration.

Planned for Parts 2–8: authentication, transactions, monthly budgets, dashboard and charts, validation, pagination, CSV export, and submission documentation.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken are installed for Part 2. No authentication is implemented yet.

## Project Structure

```text
frontend/
  public/
  src/
    components/ context/ layouts/ pages/ services/ utils/
    App.jsx main.jsx index.css
  .env.example index.html package.json vite.config.js
backend/
  config/ controllers/ middleware/ models/ routes/ utils/
  .env.example app.js server.js package.json
.gitignore
README.md
```

Empty folders contain `.gitkeep` files so Git preserves the intended structure. No application models exist in Part 1.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Node.js 22.12+ (Node 24 LTS recommended), npm, and a running local MongoDB server or a MongoDB Atlas connection. Run the following PowerShell commands from the project root after cloning. Copy environment files only on first setup; do not overwrite existing configured files.

```powershell
npm.cmd ci --prefix backend
npm.cmd ci --prefix frontend
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
Copy-Item frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

## Environment Variables

`backend/.env`:

```dotenv
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/expense_budget_tracker
JWT_SECRET=
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

`JWT_SECRET` is intentionally empty and unused in Part 1. Before Part 2, generate a private value using `node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"` and save it only in `backend/.env`. Never commit it. Replace MONGODB_URI if using Atlas; do not put credentials in `.env.example`.

`frontend/.env`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Vite exposes `VITE_` values publicly; never put secrets there. Restart the relevant server after changing environment files. CLIENT_URL must match the frontend origin, without a trailing slash.

## Running the Backend

In a terminal at the project root:

```powershell
cd backend
npm.cmd run dev
```

Expected startup: `MongoDB connected.` followed by the API listening on port 5000. The HTTP server starts only after a successful database connection. `npm.cmd start` runs without watch mode.

## Running the Frontend

In a separate terminal at the project root:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The screen should be styled with a pale background, green accents, and a responsive foundation card. The backend health message appears after the live request completes.

Tailwind CSS uses `@tailwindcss/vite` in `vite.config.js` and `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/index.css`; no separate Tailwind configuration file is required for this setup.

## API Overview

`GET /api/health` returns HTTP 200:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Expense & Budget Tracker API is running"
}
```

Unknown routes return HTTP 404 and a consistent JSON error. Invalid JSON returns 400. Oversized request bodies return 413. The health route is a basic liveness endpoint; it is not a continuous database-readiness monitor.

## Verification

With both servers running, use a third terminal:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl.exe -i http://localhost:5000/api/missing
npm.cmd run build --prefix frontend
node --check backend/server.js
node --check backend/app.js
node --check backend/config/db.js
```

Confirm the startup log reports MongoDB connected. Check the page at desktop, tablet, and 320px widths; the card should stack and text should fit. Open `/missing` and use Return home to verify routing. Stop the backend, click Check connection, confirm the error state, then restart and retry. No authentication or financial functionality should be expected yet.

Common errors:

- MongoDB connection failed: confirm the MongoDB service is running and MONGODB_URI is correct. For Atlas, check network access and credentials.
- Port already in use: stop the conflicting process or change PORT and VITE_API_URL together. If changing the frontend port, also update CLIENT_URL and Vite's server port.
- API unreachable/CORS: check both environment files, start both servers, and use the exact frontend origin configured in CLIENT_URL.
- Unsupported Node engine: use Node.js 22.12+.
- PowerShell blocks npm.ps1: use the documented `npm.cmd` commands.
- Windows reports `Budget is not recognized`: the project path contains `&`, which can break the npm-generated Vite command shim. The supplied npm scripts invoke Vite through Node directly to support this path.
- Git reports dubious ownership after sandbox initialization: use `git -c safe.directory="D:/Gamage Projects/Expense & Budget Tracker" status` (and the same `-c` option for add/commit) for this known workspace, without changing global Git settings.

## Git Workflow

If the folder has not been initialized, run `git init` once. Review files before committing:

```powershell
git status --short
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initialize full-stack expense tracker project"
```

`.env`, dependencies, logs, and build output are ignored; example environment files and lockfiles should be committed. Continue one part at a time and create a meaningful commit after each part.

## Screenshots

Final screenshots will be captured after the corresponding pages are implemented: login/register, dashboard, transactions, and budget.

## Author

The assignment author's name will be supplied during submission preparation.

## Development Progress

Part 1 foundation implemented. Part 2 will add the User model, registration/login, password hashing, JWT generation, and protected `/api/auth/me`. Wait for explicit `continue` before beginning the next part.
